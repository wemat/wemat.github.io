# Wemat's private Projects

I am intersted in data, programming, solving problems and create something from scratch. The way to do this things is by learning by doing. So here I will link a few selected projects that I worked on. 

The scope of the projects vary from mini (1 day or less), medium (1-3 weeks) to large (several months). 

## 1. Sports Analytics 
Scope: Medium 
Tech: Rest API, Python with Dash, Plotly, Pandas,Requests

I use the Strava App when I go for a run or mountain biking. In this project I pull my data from the Rest API and use it to create a sports-analytics dashboard.
