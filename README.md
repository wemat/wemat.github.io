# Wemat's private Projects

I like data, programming, solving problems and create something from scratch. Learning by doing is my approach. So here are  a few selected projects that I worked on. 

The scope of the projects vary from small (1 day or less), medium (1-3 weeks) to large (several months). 

## 1. Sports Analytics 
Scope: Medium 
Tech: Rest API, Python with Dash, Plotly, Pandas,Requests

I use the Strava App when I go for a run or mountain biking. In this project I pull the data from the Rest API and use it to create a sports-analytics dashboard.

Code: <a href="https://github.com/wemat/StravaDash">Github StavaDash</a>

## 2. Real Time Production Dashboard in Power BI 
Scope: Small
Tech: Python, Power BI
I am using python to push the Data to the REST API of Power BI. 
The data is generated in real time by a simple simulation of a machine's productivity.

## 3. Pytorch Implementation of the famous Paper 'Attention is all you need'
Scope: Medium
Tech: Python with Pytorch, Pandas 

> descripition and code coming soon. 

## 4. Webapplication - Website and Reservation Tool 
Scope: Large
Tech: Python, Django, MySQL, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS

I developed <a href="https://www.tuoretta.ch/">this</a>  Website. Users can create an account and make reservations. I created a calendar widget from scratch that shows the availability for the website visitors and the bookings with the names for the logged in users. 


## 5. Mars Lander 
Scope: Medium-Large
Tech: Python

I love <a href="https://www.codingame.com/start">CodinGame</a>. (find me on CG: wemat) Soon after I begann programming this Site really pushed me to learn more. By now I solved two "very hard-", a buch of "hard-" and altogether around 40 puzzles. Even though I am not a professional developer it is a lot of fun to implement an algorithm from scratch :)

One really interesting puzzle is the Mars Lander. The goal of this puzzle is to safely land a spaceship on Mars. 
To solve this I programmed a genetic algorithm. But first I had to create a physics simulation of the rockets trajectory. It took me several weeks to make it work and I still will have to optimize the algorithm's speed to crack all the tests :)
